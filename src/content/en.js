      'Zero-Vector Design is a discipline, a philosophy, and a practical approach to making things. It consists of seven principles that guide decision-making, an eight-phase approach that covers everything from the seed of an idea to shipping it, an open curriculum that anyone can follow, and a growing community of practitioners who build real things with AI agents as crew.',
      'It is not abstract. It is not theoretical. It is a set of guidelines, resources, and tools that help you go from concept to customer without the translation layers that have defined product development for decades. The research. The synthesis. The design. The build. The ship. All of it, connected, with one person holding the vision across the entire arc.',
      'Zero-Vector is opinionated about approach and agnostic about tools. It does not care whether you use Claude or Cursor or whatever ships next Tuesday. It cares that you work in the medium, that you understand the problem before you build the solution, and that craft survives the transformation.',

        'Then it became something more. In physics and aerospace telemetry, a zero vector describes a state of no relative motion between two objects. Perfect alignment, no drift, no error. When a spacecraft achieves zero vector relative to its target, it means the gap between where it is and where it intends to be is exactly zero. Intent and position are identical.',
        'That is the principle. Zero distance between what you envision and what gets built. No drift between the designer\'s intent and the artifact that ships. No error introduced by translation layers, handoffs, or intermediaries. The gap is zero.',
        'In quantum mechanics, a zero vector represents the null state, the origin point from which all other states are measured. In navigation, it is the reference frame. In Zero-Vector Design, it is both: the starting point for a new discipline and the state we are always trying to achieve. Perfect fidelity. No signal loss. The vision, realized.',

I have done it at startups, at agencies, at federal agencies, and at NASA. And for most of those thirty-one years, I have been fighting the same gap.',

        'In aerospace, "zero vector" means a state of no relative motion, perfect stillness between two objects. No drift. No error. Complete alignment between intent and position.

Each time, the industry needed someone to name the thing, frame it, and show people how to do it.',

It is a paradigm shift, and it needs someone who has been through paradigm shifts before to help people navigate it.',

Lean principles from Ries. Blue ocean strategy from Kim and Mauborgne. Quality philosophy from Taguchi.
