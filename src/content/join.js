    'Zero Vector is building something new. Not a product. Not a company. A **discipline** \u2014 a way of working where design intent and code execution share the same moment. Open source. Open methodology. Built in public.',

The methodology is gaining real traction, the partnership pipeline is active, and the founder\u2019s track record suggests this is not a hobby. But belief is not a paycheck.
