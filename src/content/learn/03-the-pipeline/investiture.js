          'You have just spent seven lessons walking through the full product development pipeline: research, synthesis, jobs to be done, ideation, prototyping, validation, shipping. That is a lot of thinking. A lot of artifacts. A lot of decisions.',

          'No. That is what Investiture solves.',
          'Investiture is a project scaffold with a skill chain that enforces your doctrine. Run npx investiture init in any existing project and it injects structured research schemas, architecture skills, and the VECTOR.md convention without touching your code. Or clone the full scaffold for a greenfield project with React, Vite, and the doctrine system built in.',
          'As of v1.3, Investiture includes three executable skills (/invest-backfill, /invest-doctrine, /invest-architecture) that read your doctrine files at runtime and audit your project against them. Backfill surveys your codebase and generates starter doctrine. Doctrine validates it. Architecture enforces it.',

In Zero Vector, Investiture is the fundamental structure that powers all projects. Different projects, different features, but the same underlying architecture making it all work.',

          'Every time you start a new project from scratch, you make hundreds of small decisions: Where do components go? How do I structure the API? What does my folder hierarchy look like? How do I handle environment variables? Where does documentation live?',
          'Most people make these decisions ad hoc. They create folders as needed, name things inconsistently, scatter configuration across multiple files. The project works, technically. But it is held together with implicit knowledge that lives only in the original developer\'s head.',
          'Now multiply that problem by AI agents. An agent reading a project with no consistent structure, no documentation, no architectural reasoning has to guess at conventions. It guesses wrong. You fix it. It guesses wrong again. You spend more time correcting the agent than you would have spent writing the code yourself.',
          'Investiture eliminates that entire class of problem. The structure is explicit. The conventions are documented. The architecture is explained. An AI agent reading an Investiture project knows where things go, why they go there, and what patterns to follow.',
